# PostgreSQL configuration

PL/Rust has two **required** configuration options and a variety of non-required options.
These options are set in the standard `postgresql.conf` configuration file used
by PostgreSQL.


## Required configuration

PL/Rust has two required configuration options in untrusted and trusted installations.
Using PL/Rust with cross compilation support has a 3rd required configuration option.
Failure to set these variables
will cause `plrust` extension to not function.



## Always required

The [`shared_preload_libraries` entry](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html)
needs to include `plrust`, and the `plrust.work_dir` must be set to a writable
location for PL/Rust to save necessary intermediate files.


```
shared_preload_libraries = 'plrust'
plrust.work_dir = '/tmp'
```

## Required for cross compile


`plrust.compilation_targets`




## All configuration options


The PL/Rust-specific configuration options are in the following table.

For PL/Rust to cross compile user functions it needs to know which CPU architectures via
`plrust.compilation_targets`. This is a comma-separated list of values, of which only `x86_64` and `aarch64` are
currently supported.

The architecture linker names have sane defaults and shouldn't need to be be changed (unless the host is some
esoteric Linux distro we haven't encountered yet).

The `plrust.{arch}_pgx_bindings_path` settings are actually required but PL/Rust will happily cross compile without them. If unspecified,
PL/Rust will use the pgx bindings of the host architecture for the cross compilation target architecture too. In other words, if the host 
is `x86_64` and PL/Rust is configured to cross compile to `aarch64` and the `plrust.aarch64_pgx_bindings_path` is *not* configured, it'll
blindly use the bindings it already has for `x86_64`.  This may or may not actually work.

To get the bindings, install `cargo-pgx` on the other system and run `cargo pgx cross pgx-target`. That'll generate a tarball. Copy that back 
to the primary host machine and untar it somewhere (plrust doesn't care where), and use that path as the configuration setting.

Note that it is perfectly fine (and really, expected) to set all of these configuration settings on both architectures.
plrust will silently ignore the one for the current host.  In other words, plrust only uses them when cross compiling for 
the other architecture.
